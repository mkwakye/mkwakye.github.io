                        My name is Denea Pascoe and I am a Sophomore at Howard University, 
                        Washington, DC. My dream job is to become a corporate lawyer 
                        Corporate law fascinates me because it encompasses the dynamic and 
                        complex world of business. To reach my dream job goal, I am committed 
                        to a path of continuous learning and professional development and have 
                        pursued rigorous coursework in my undergraduate studies. Becoming a 
                        corporate lawyer is not just a career aspiration but a lifelong mission to 
                        make a positive impact and create a more just and inclusive society.

                        Nyla Clarke is a graduating senior with a passion for media, education, 
                        and community service. Throughout high school, she has been involved 
                        in student journalism, drama production, and service organizations such 
                        as the National Honor Society and her school’s food bank. She currently 
                        works as an after-school kindergarten teacher at her local elementary 
                        school, where she supports and inspires young learners. Nyla also 
                        works as a French tutor and a dedicated babysitter, while balancing her 
                        academic goals. This fall, she will attend Towson University to study 
                        Human and Family Services, with the goal of becoming a family social 
                        worker and advocacy lawyer.

                        Wheaton high school and Thomas Edison in May 2025. I was born and 
                        raised in Silver Spring, Maryland. I’ve devoted over 300 community 
                        service hours with the Silver Spring Saints organization helping our 
                        youth build character, sportsmanship, and self-confidence. I recently 
                        earned my CompTIA Security+ certification while attending Thomas 
                        Edison. I will be pursuing my dreams of becoming a data analyst while 
                        attending UMBC studying computer science and cybersecurity this fall. I 
                        am extremely appreciative to everyone who has encouraged and guided

                        As a first-generation Jamaican-Guyanese American, I’ve long been driven 
                        to build a global fashion brand that amplifies the voices and creativity of 
                        people of color. Inspired by my upbringing, shaped by the tragic loss of 
                        my brother to gun violence, and motivated by a passion for advocacy, 
                        my goal is to merge fashion and social justice, creating futuristic designs 
                        that tell stories and spark change. From early entrepreneurial ventures to 
                        internships at Baltimore Fashion Week and Doll House Boutique, I’ve
                         embraced the arts as a vehicle for empowerment. Now, through my work 
                        with AMA Baltimore and my upcoming studies in International Business at 
                        George Washington University, I am building the tools to turn fashion into 
                        a force for global impact, inclusivity, and healing, one garment at a time.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 ">
                        My name is Gianna Robinson, a graduating senior at Howard University, 
                        school of Business Administration in Finance. I aspire to become a leader 
                        in real estate development, creating sustainable, affordable housing 
                        that restores dignity to underserved communities. Housing is not just 
                        about building, it is about creating spaces where people can thrive, raise 
                        families and build their futures. I want to integrate health and wellness 
                        initiatives into my developments because I understand that housing and 
                        health are deeply connected. My experiences in community service, HIV 
                        awareness, and financial literacy initiatives have shown me that the real 
                        estate industry has the power to transform lives when done with intention 
                        and care. Beyond my career, my heart remains tied to Trinidad and 
                        Tobago, my home. Ultimately, my life’s work will be about building…building communities, building 
                        opportunities and building a legacy of impact and service.
