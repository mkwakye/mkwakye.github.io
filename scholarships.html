                            the importance of giving back to the community, and of maintaining and
                            strengthening their link to their heritage.
                            We trust that our example will inspire both scholarship recipients and their
                            supporters to continue the tradition of giving and make it possible for an
                            even greater number of students to benefit.”

                        <p>The WIAMMA Scholarship, sponsored by individuals of Caribbean descent, who have served or are serving in the 
                            United States Armed Forces, provides funds to any student whose parent(s) have served in the U.S. Armed Forces.
                        </p>
                        <p>“One of WIAMMA’s goals is to make a difference in the
                            Caribbean community. Our relationship with the Caribbean
                            Students’ Scholarship Fund, (CSSF, Inc.) program is a
                            testament of our commitment to that cause.
                            Our experience in the U.S. Armed Forces has been the
                            foundation for the success in the lives of our members, and
                            we can only trust that our contributions to the Caribbean Students’ Scholarship Fund Inc. will be the
                            foundation that impacts change in the lives of our recipients. We hope they will not only keep the
                            American flag flying high but also those of the Caribbean as well. We look forward to staying united
                            with the CSSF program for a very long time.”</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the West Indian-American Military Members Association is to promote awareness, increase 
                            understanding and recognize the contributions of West Indian-Americans to the United States military. 
                            This is done through the exchange of culture, promoting diversity through education and celebration. 
                            Membership is extended to all who were born in the West Indies, or of West Indian parentage, and/or are 
                            married to a West Indian, and have served in any branch of the US Milatary.
